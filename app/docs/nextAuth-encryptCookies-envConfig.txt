==> Setting up NextAuth.js

Install NextAuth.js by running the following command in your terminal:

==> Terminal:

--> npm install next-auth@beta

Here, you're installing the beta version of NextAuth.js, which is compatible with Next.js 14.

Next, generate a secret key for your application. This key is used to encrypt cookies, ensuring the security of user sessions.
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

==> Terminal:

--> openssl rand -base64 32

Then, in your .env file, add your generated key to the AUTH_SECRET variable:

==> .env:

--> AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

For auth to work in production, you'll need to update your environment variables in your Vercel project too.
